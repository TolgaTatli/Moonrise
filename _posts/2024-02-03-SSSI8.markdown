# 8th Symposium of Sedimentological Society of Iran

### January 31, 2024: A Day of Learning and Sharing

On January 31, 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the 8th Symposium of the Sedimentological Society of Iran at the University of Hormozgan. This event brought together some of the brightest minds in sedimentology and geology from across the country. The atmosphere was electric with excitement and intellectual curiosity.

I presented my poster titled "Application of PCA Algorithm in Remote Sensing using Python Programming Language (Case Study: Landsat 9 Multispectral Images)." It was thrilling to share my research with fellow scientists and researchers. The PCA algorithm, as many of you know, is a powerful tool for reducing the dimensionality of large datasets, and applying it to Landsat 9 multispectral images has opened up new possibilities for geological mapping.

### Engaging with the Scientific Community

Standing by my poster, I engaged in numerous discussions about the potential applications of PCA in remote sensing. Many attendees were intrigued by the use of Python for this purpose, and we exchanged ideas on how to further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of geological mapping techniques. It was a fantastic learning experience, and I walked away with new insights and potential collaborations.

### A Journey to The Magical Island

After the symposium, I embarked on an exciting adventure with three friends to Hormuz Island. Known for its breathtaking landscapes and unique geological features, Hormuz Island is a must-visit for any geology enthusiast. Here you can find the crew members:

As we approached the island by ferry, the vibrant colors of the landscape came into view. The island's famous red soil and multicolored rock formations were even more stunning in person. We spent the day hiking through the rugged terrain, exploring the salt dome, and marveling at the island's rich mineral deposits.

One of the highlights was collecting samples of the vividly colored soil and rocks. Each sample was a piece of the island's geological puzzle, and I couldn't help but draw connections between the real-world features we were observing and the satellite images I had analyzed. It was a profound reminder of the importance of fieldwork in complementing remote sensing research.

### Reflecting on the Experience

As the sun set over Hormuz Island, casting a golden hue over the landscape, we found a quiet spot to rest and reflect on our adventure. The trip was more than just a field excursion; it was a journey of discovery, both academically and personally. I returned to Bandar Abbas with a heart full of memories and a renewed passion for my work.

### Looking Ahead

Attending the symposium and exploring Hormuz Island has been an unforgettable experience. It reinforced the importance of sharing knowledge, engaging with the scientific community, and appreciating the natural wonders of our world. I am excited to continue my research and look forward to future opportunities to learn and grow.
