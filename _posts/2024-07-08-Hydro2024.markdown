I’m thrilled to share that I’ve embarked on an enriching academic endeavor at the University of Lille, France. The Hydro 2024 Pre-PhD summer school is offering an invaluable experience as I immerse myself in the intricate world of hydrology, hydrogeology, and water resources management. This venture is not only a step forward in my educational path but also a gateway to pioneering research and global water sustainability. Here You can find a Picture from me durning this Program

During this program, I had the pleasure of visiting Bruges in Belgium, a city often referred to as “the Venice of the North” due to its stunning canals. Bruges is a place where history and beauty intertwine seamlessly. As I wandered through its cobblestone streets, I was captivated by the medieval architecture, charming bridges, and serene waterways that crisscross the city.<br>

One of the highlights of my visit was a boat tour along the canals. Gliding through the water, I had the chance to see Bruges from a unique perspective, passing by picturesque houses, historic buildings, and lush gardens. The reflections of the ancient structures in the calm waters created a magical atmosphere, making it easy to understand why Bruges is so beloved by travelers.

During my visit to Bruges, I couldn’t resist indulging in some of the city’s famous Belgian chocolates. Among the many delightful treats, I found the most charming duck-shaped chocolates, which immediately caught my eye. As a duck enthusiast, these adorable chocolates were a perfect find!

For the weekend, I took a train to Paris to visit the iconic Eiffel Tower. Honestly, it had been my dream since childhood to visit Paris during my 20s, and finally, that dream came true.

On the last day we have an Oral Defense project, where Me and Sina Mohammadian presented on "Numerical groundwater Modelling under changing water abstraction in Weyib watershed, Ethiopia".

It was a fantastic experience!
The Hydro 2024 summer school at International Academy Lille Hauts-de-France allowed me to learn in an international academic environment. In addition to the cultural events in beautiful Lille, I socialized with students from other nations.<br>
Learning new subjects was also enjoyable, and I intend to implement them in my future research. Here, I want to express my gratitude to Prof. Arnaud Gauthier, Dr. Sana Ounaies, Dr. philippe Le Coustumer, Prof. Isam Shahrour, Dr. Hande Okutan, Prof. Baghdad Ouddane, and Dr. Florence BOUVET-GEFFROY for their valuable lectures and all efforts during this summer school.
