I’m thrilled to share that I’ve embarked on an enriching academic endeavor at the University of Lille, France. The Hydro 2024 Pre-PhD summer school is offering an invaluable experience as I immerse myself in the intricate world of hydrology, hydrogeology, and water resources management. This venture is not only a step forward in my educational path but also a gateway to pioneering research and global water sustainability. Here You can find a Picture from me durning this Program

It was a fantastic experience!
The Hydro 2024 summer school at International Academy Lille Hauts-de-France allowed me to learn in an international academic environment. In addition to the cultural events in beautiful Lille, I socialized with students from other nations.<br>
Learning new subjects was also enjoyable, and I intend to implement them in my future research. Here, I want to express my gratitude to Prof. Arnaud Gauthier, Dr. Sana Ounaies, Dr. philippe Le Coustumer, Prof. Isam Shahrour, Dr. Hande Okutan, Prof. Baghdad Ouddane, and Dr. Florence BOUVET-GEFFROY for their valuable lectures and all efforts during this summer school.
