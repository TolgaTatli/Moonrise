# Turning Challenges into Opportunities: A Pythonic Solution to Geospatial Problems

Yesterday, faced with a homework assignment to create a DEM with contours in QGIS by CSV format file, I encountered an unexpected hurdle — a technical glitch with the software. Not one to be deterred by such setbacks, I turned to Python, a language known for its versatility and robustness in handling geospatial data.<br>
Leveraging libraries like GDAL, Geopandas and Matplotlib, I was able to replicate the process of visualizing elevation contours from raster DEMs. The journey through Python’s rich ecosystem of packages was not just a workaround but an enlightening experience that honed my problem-solving skills.<br>
This experience was a reminder that sometimes, the tools we rely on might fail us, but our determination to find solutions shouldn’t. It’s about being adaptable, learning to code on the fly, and embracing the unexpected twists in our technical endeavors. [Here](https://github.com/aradfarahani/DEM-Bathymetry/blob/main/DEM%20%2B%20contour.ipynb) you can find some more information about the software. also in this Repository I upload some others stuff about the 3D Visualization for DEM.
