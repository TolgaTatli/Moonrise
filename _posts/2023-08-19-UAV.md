**Creating Point Cloud, DEM, and Orthomosaic Map from Abyek County, Qazvin Province, Iran Using UAV**

**June 2023 - August 2023**

**Associated with Maan Academy**

In the summer of 2023, I embarked on an exciting project to create a Point Cloud, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and Orthomosaic map of Abyek County in Qazvin Province, Iran. This project was conducted in collaboration with Maan Academy and involved the use of advanced UAV technology and photogrammetry software.

### Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to generate high-resolution geospatial data for Abyek County. This data would be invaluable for various applications, including geological studies, urban planning, and environmental monitoring.

### Methodology

1. **Establish Ground Control Points (GCPs)**:
   - We established 10 Ground Control Points across the survey area.
   - The geographical coordinates of these points were recorded using a Base and Rover system to ensure high accuracy.

2. **Image Capture**:
   - Using the DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0 drone, we captured over 250 images of the area.
   - The images were taken with an overlap of 80% to ensure comprehensive coverage and accurate stitching.

3. **Photo Alignment**:
   - The captured images were imported into Agisoft Metashape, a powerful photogrammetry software.
   - We aligned the photos to create a coherent and accurate representation of the survey area.

4. **Build Point Cloud**:
   - From the aligned photos, we generated a dense Point Cloud.
   - This Point Cloud provided a detailed 3D representation of the terrain and features of Abyek County.

5. **Build Digital Elevation Model (DEM)**:
   - Using the Point Cloud data, we constructed a Digital Elevation Model.
   - The DEM offered a precise representation of the terrain's elevation, which is crucial for geological and environmental analysis.

6. **Build Orthomosaic Map**:
   - Finally, we created an Orthomosaic map from the aligned photos.
   - This map provided a high-resolution, georeferenced image of the survey area, which can be used for detailed visual analysis and mapping.

### Skills Utilized

- **Agisoft Metashape**: For photo alignment, Point Cloud generation, DEM creation, and Orthomosaic mapping.
- **Drone Mapping**: Utilizing UAV technology for high-resolution image capture.
- **Geology**: Applying geological knowledge to interpret and analyze the geospatial data.

### Conclusion

This project was a significant achievement in utilizing UAV technology and photogrammetry for geospatial data collection and analysis. The high-resolution Point Cloud, DEM, and Orthomosaic map of Abyek County will serve as valuable resources for various applications, contributing to better understanding and management of the region's natural and urban environments.
