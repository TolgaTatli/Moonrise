**A Quick Escape to the Caspian Sea**

During one of Dr. Rezaei's captivating classes on sedimentary rocks, I stumbled upon an unbelievable fact about the Caspian Sea. Intrigued and eager to explore, I shared this newfound knowledge with my colleague, Mohammad Javad, a Mathematics (Topology) PhD candidate at Iran University of Science and Technology. The idea of seeing the Caspian Sea up close was too tempting to resist, so we decided to take a spontaneous trip to Sari.

Without wasting any time, we booked our plane tickets and soon found ourselves soaring above the clouds, heading towards the northern coast of Iran. The flight was filled with excitement and anticipation as we discussed the wonders of the Caspian Sea and what we might discover there.

Upon landing in Sari, we made our way to the shore. The sight of the vast, shimmering expanse of the Caspian Sea was nothing short of breathtaking. The gentle waves lapping against the shore and the fresh sea breeze created a serene and peaceful atmosphere. We spent some time exploring the coastline, marveling at the unique geological formations and the beauty of the natural landscape.

However, our adventure was short-lived as we both had a mountain of work waiting for us back in Tehran. Reluctantly, we bid farewell to the Caspian Sea and headed to the train station for our journey back to the bustling city.

The train ride back to Tehran was a perfect opportunity to reflect on our spontaneous trip. We shared our thoughts and experiences, discussing how the brief escape had recharged our spirits and provided a much-needed break from our academic pursuits.

As we arrived back in Tehran, we felt a renewed sense of energy and motivation to tackle our work. This quick escape to the Caspian Sea reminded us of the importance of taking a step back and appreciating the beauty of the world around us, even amidst our busy schedules.
