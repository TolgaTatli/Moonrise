**A Geological Adventure: Field Trips with Dr. Khalil Rezaei**

As part of our Sedimentology Course at Kharazmi University, we had the incredible opportunity to embark on two exciting field trips led by our professor, Dr. Khalil Rezaei. Dr. Rezaei, known for his expertise in geology and geomorphology, brought our textbook knowledge to life through these hands-on experiences.


Our first expedition took us to Taleqan on October 27, 2022. The crisp autumn air added to the excitement as we set out to explore the geological wonders of this region. Taleqan, with its diverse landscape, provided a perfect outdoor laboratory for our sedimentology studies. We examined various rock formations, discussing their origins and the processes that shaped them over millions of years.

Less than a month later, on November 20, 2022, we found ourselves in Qom for our second field trip. The contrast between Taleqan and Qom was striking, offering us a chance to compare and contrast different geological settings. In Qom, we focused on the unique sedimentary structures that make this area a goldmine for geological research.

Throughout both trips, Dr. Rezaei's passion for geology was contagious. He encouraged us to think critically, asking probing questions that pushed us to apply our classroom knowledge to real-world scenarios. His expertise in urban soil and sediment zoning added an interesting dimension to our observations, helping us understand the practical applications of our studies.

One of the most memorable moments of our field trips came when Dr. Rezaei decided to use me as a scale in one of his studies. It's a common practice in geology to include a familiar object or person in photographs to provide a sense of scale, but I never expected to be that reference point!

As I stood next to a particularly interesting rock formation, Dr. Rezaei instructed me on where to stand and how to position myself. I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness, knowing that my image would be part of a scientific study. It was a unique experience that made me feel directly involved in the research process.

This moment highlighted the importance of scale in geological studies. Without a reference point, it can be challenging to convey the true size of geological features in photographs. By using a person (in this case, me) as a scale, Dr. Rezaei ensured that anyone viewing the photograph would immediately understand the dimensions of the formation.

These field trips were more than just educational experiences; they were adventures that brought our studies to life. From the breathtaking landscapes of Taleqan to the geological marvels of Qom, each location offered unique insights into the world of sedimentology. 

Dr. Rezaei's guidance and expertise made these trips invaluable, providing us with practical skills and a deeper understanding of geological processes. And for me, the experience of being a 'human scale' in a scientific study added a personal touch to our academic journey, one that I'll always remember fondly.

As I reflect on these experiences, I'm grateful for the hands-on learning opportunities provided by our Sedimentology Course. These field trips not only enhanced our understanding of geological concepts but also gave us a taste of what it's like to conduct field research. They've inspired me to look at the world around me with a geologist's eye, always curious about the stories written in stone beneath our feet.
