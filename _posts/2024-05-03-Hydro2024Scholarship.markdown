# ðŸŽ‰ Big News: Scholarship Award for Hydro 2024 Summer School!ðŸŽ‰

I am thrilled to announce that I have been selected for a full scholarship to attend the prestigious Hydro 2024 summer school in Lille, France! This opportunity is not just a personal achievement but a milestone in my academic journey.<br>
I'm looking forward to an enriching experience, where I'll be diving deep into the world of hydro sciences, networking with peers, and exploring the beautiful city of Lille.<br>
A huge thank you to the Hydro team and the French Embassy for their support and coordination. Also, a shoutout to the selection committee for considering my application and awarding me this honor.<br>

To my fellow candidates and future classmates, *I can't wait to meet you all in person this summer!*
