## Our Geoelectrics Project at Gandak Waste Disposal Center

### Introduction

On November 22, 2022, a diverse team of geoscientists and specialists embarked on an exciting research project at the Gandak Waste Disposal Center in Damavand County, Tehran Province, Iran. The project aimed to investigate the amount of waste leachate and calculate the water pollution in the area using geoelectric methods. This research was conducted under the Supervised of Dr. Khalil Rezaei and proved to be a fantastic experience for all involved.

### The Team

Our team comprised:
- **Arad(Myself)**: B.Sc. Geology, Kharazmi University (KhU)
- **Afshin**: B.Sc. Geology, KhU
- **Sheyda**: M.Sc. Sedimentology, KhU
- **Alireza**: B.Sc. Geology, KhU
- **Mr. Bari**: M.Sc. Geophysics, University of Tehran (UT)
- **Mr. Bari's Friend**: M.Sc. Bioinformatics, UT

### Project Objectives

The primary objectives of our project were:
- To assess the extent of waste leachate in the Gandak Waste Disposal Center.
- To evaluate the water pollution levels using geoelectric methods.
- To visualize the collected data in 3D for better interpretation and presentation.

### Methodology

We employed geoelectric methods, specifically geoelectrical tomography, to achieve our objectives. This technique is highly effective for environmental studies, particularly for mapping subsurface features and detecting contaminants like leachates.

#### Geoelectrical Tomography

Geoelectrical tomography involves injecting a direct current into the ground and measuring the resulting potential differences. By systematically varying the distances between electrodes, we can create a detailed image of the subsurface resistivity. This method is particularly useful for identifying areas with high conductivity, which typically indicate the presence of leachates.

#### Data Collection and Analysis

We used a multielectrode array to collect resistivity data at various points across the study area. The data was then processed using specialized software, such as Geoelectrispy, to generate 2D and 3D resistivity models of the subsurface. These models helped us identify zones of low resistivity, which are indicative of leachate contamination.

### Findings

Our geoelectrical survey revealed several key insights:
- **Leachate Pathways**: We identified multiple pathways through which leachates were migrating into the groundwater system. These pathways were primarily oriented in the south-north and southeast-northwest directions, likely influenced by underlying geological faults.
- **Contamination Zones**: The data indicated significant zones of contamination, with leachate mixing into the aquiferous units at depths ranging from 4 to 30 meters. These zones were characterized by very low electrical resistivity, suggesting high levels of contamination.
- **3D Visualization**: For more information follow the [Geoelectricspy](https://aradfarahani.com//Geoelectricspy/)

### Conclusion

The geoelectric project at the Gandak Waste Disposal Center was a resounding success. It not only provided valuable data on the extent of leachate contamination but also offered an excellent opportunity for hands-on experience with advanced geophysical techniques. As the team member responsible for 3D data visualization, I found the project particularly rewarding and educational.

### Personal Reflection

Working on this project was an incredible learning experience. The collaboration with experts from various fields, the application of advanced geophysical methods, and the opportunity to contribute to an important environmental study made this project truly memorable. I am grateful to Dr. Khalil Rezaei for his guidance and to my team members for their dedication and hard work.

This project has reinforced my passion for geology and environmental science, and I look forward to participating in more such impactful research in the future.
